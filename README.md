# Genius Chat v5.0.0

Genius Chat is a website that was originally created as a place for my friends and I to communicate after school, on a platform that everybody could access -no social media required! 

I started by coding the website in rudimentary HTML and CSS. Just wait until I heard that I needed a database, and a server, and a way to log changes (Why is it named Git, anyway?!) But the chat needed to be made. So I enlisted the help of my dad's server, and recruited my friend @mh-anwar, who had personal stake in the development in the website. If you browse this repository's version history, you will see that as our chat website grew, so did our coding skills.

Two years after its creation, the website has received 158 commits and broadcasted over 80,000 messages. This doesn't even include the code that I had created before uploading to GitHub! 

We are currently in the midst of planning a completely revamped chat website that follows proper coding conventions and updated libraries from the very start.
