# Genius Chat v5.0.0

Genius Chat is a website that was originally created as a place for my friends and I to communicate after school, on a platform that everybody could access -no social media required! 

## GC: The lore 
*CIRCA 2020...*

I remember starting to code the website in plain HTML and CSS. If you look to the right of this text, I had barely created half of that at the time. Of course, HTML and CSS together are not much more than a selectable image, and so I had to look to using other tools...

This led me to learning JavaScript (my beloved!). With the help of the internet, I managed to create a rudimentary message submitting system and moving parts, but when I closed the page, well... nothing saved! It was at that moment that I learned what was really under the hood of a website. I needed something called a database, and a hosting platform, and a way to log changes (Why is it named Git, anyway?!)<br/>

But the chat had to go on. So I enlisted the help of my dad's server, and recruited my friend `@mh-anwar`, and we got to work. As you browse this repository's version history, you will see that as our chat website grew, so did our coding skills.

## FINAL FEATURES:
- Secure login system with API key
- Dark mode and accessibility mode for my colourblind friend
- Message replies! (Before Discord)
- Built-in markdown using regular expressions
		- Hashtags are shown as blue
		- Links are automatically detected
		- HTML tag support ("strong","em","mark","ins",etc)
- All inputs cleaned using DOMpurify to prevent cross-site scripting (XXS)
- multi-tab system for quick links
- working mobile integration
- fun quotes generator
- inline emotes and gifs
- chat emptying system for "sus" messages
- "system commands" not associated with any users
- and much more...

## Two years after its creation... 
The website has received over 160 commits and broadcasted over 80,000 messages. This doesn't even include the code that I had created before uploading to GitHub! Although you might not call it Discord (we argue that it's better), I can honestly say that this chat platform taught me so much about web development and programming in general, and I know that I 100% want to spend the rest of my life in the amazing industry of CS.

We are currently in the midst of planning a completely revamped chat website that follows proper coding conventions and updated libraries from the very start.
