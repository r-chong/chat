# Genius Chat v4.1.0

Genius Chat is a website originally created as a place for my friends and I to communicate after school on a platform that everybody could access -no social media required. 

Two years after its creation, the website has received 158 commits and broadcasted over 80,000 messages. This doesn't even include the code that I had created before uploading to GitHub! 

We are currently in the midst of planning a completely revamped chat website that follows proper coding conventions and updated libraries from the very start.
