# Genius Chat v5.0.0

Genius Chat is a website that was originally created as a place for my friends and I to communicate after school, on a platform that everybody could access -no social media required!

I started by coding the website in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. But when I closed the page, well... nothing saved! It was at that moment that I learned what was really under the hood of a website. I needed something called a database, and a hosting platform, and a way to log changes (Why is it named Git, anyway?!)<br/>

But the chat had to be made. So I enlisted the help of my dad's server, and recruited my friend @mh-anwar, who had.. personal stake in the development in the website. It was quite time consuming, but we learned so much! As you browse this repository's version history, you will see that as our chat website grew, so did our coding skills.

Two years after its creation, the website has received 160+ commits and broadcasted over 80,000 messages. This doesn't even include the code that I had created before uploading to GitHub! Although you might not call it Discord (we would argue that it's better), I can honestly say that I learned so much about web development and programming in general from this project, and I 100% want to spend the rest of my life in this amazing industry of CS.

We are currently in the midst of planning a completely revamped chat website that follows proper coding conventions and updated libraries from the very start.
